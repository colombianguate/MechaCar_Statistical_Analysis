## Linear Regression to Predit MPG

![line_image](resources/lm_summary.png)

In the first analysis we are using the multi-line regression model.

From the summary above, the variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance have the most impact on the mpg.

The slope of the linear model is not a zero because or p-value is 5.35e-11 is smaller than our assumed singnificance level of 0.05%, in which we can reject our null hypothesis.

The linear model doesn't predict mpg of MechaCar Prototypes effectively because of the lack of significant variables.

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The second analysis we look look into the PSI.

From the summary we can see the only lot that exceeds variance of the suspension coils by 100 PSI is lot 3. In that case lot 3 does not meet the manufacturing data.
